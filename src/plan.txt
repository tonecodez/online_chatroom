1. For assignment 3, we are essentially creating a chatroom for up to 255
clients. We are assigning each of the users a username and they will be able to
send up to 1000 words for each message. One thing that is different from a
conventional chatroom is that we have an observer client that is responsible for
displaying the chatroom, so there are technically two mediums for each of the
users: one where they send their messages, and the other where they get to read
all of the data.

2. We believe that the most challenging aspect of this assignment will be how to
synchronize all of the data so that from the users' point of view (since there
are going to be at least 255 of them), the program
runs smoothly. We have been using the recv() function in the last assignments
but while reading the assignment pdf, it seems that select() is going to be the
function that we need. Another challenging aspect seems to be affiliating an
observer with a client. We're not sure how we're going to implement that yet, 
since there will be a data flowing from server to observer and and participant 
to server, there is going to be a different dynamic in communication paths.

3. We will be looking on stackoverflow, the man pages, and if things really get
tough, we will go to Tanzima and talk with her about our project.
